# ECG-recognition
This project is the ECG recognition, which is that we collect the dog's ECG photos and identify the photo is which dog.

## First
We put the photos which are classified in the sub-files.
## Second 
we run the those different CNN models.(We use the combination of VGG and DenseNet. The other combination may be better than mine in other situation.)
## Final
Take the outputs and run the test file.
The final output is a CSV file including the photo's name and its' label.
