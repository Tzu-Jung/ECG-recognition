# ECG-recognition
This project is the ECG recognition, which is that we collect the dog's ECG photos and identify the photo is which dog.


First, we put the photos which are classified in the sub-files.
Then, we run the those different CNN models.(We use the combination of VGG and DenseNet. The other combination may be better than mine in other situation.)
Third, take the outputs and run the test file.
The final output is a CSV file including the photo's name and its' label.
